## Development of an intuitive UI system for game controlling in QT 5.0 apps

*University project I did back in 2013.*

Control of a simple 2D game with two selfmade and cheap capacitive sensors and an arduino board.
The game is written in C++/QML (Qt5) and got cross-compiled for the Raspberry Pi target.


### Hardware:

* Development of a capazitive sensor for position 		 		 recognition.
* Interpretation of the values with a ÂµC [Arduino].
* Communication with the desktop PC [Linux]

### Software:
* Communication with the Arduino [C++/SerialPort]
* Development of two simple 2D-Game Demos for representing 	 	 the results
  * Demo1: Touchless Position and shooting control
  * Demo2: Touchless velocity control
    Usage of Fragmentshaders for better effects - (worked on the Raspberry)
